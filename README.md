# ml_classification_techniques_project1
This is a Machine Learning classification project which has the following various types of datasets:
- Linearly separable data
- Non-linearly separable data
- Overlapping data

The ML classification techniques used are:
1) K-Nearest Neighbours classifier
2) Bayes and Naive Bayes classifier with a Gaussian distribution for each class
3) Bayes and Naive Bayes classifier with Gaussian Mixture Model for each class
4) Bayes Classifier with K-Nearest Neighbours method for estimation of class-conditional probability density function
