# ml_classification_techniques_project1
This is a Machine Learning classification project which has the following various types of datasets:
- Linearly separable data
- Non-linearly separable data
- Overlapping data

The ML classification techniques used are:
1) K-Nearest Neighbours classifier
2) Bayes and Naive Bayes classifier with a Gaussian distribution for each class
3) Bayes and Naive Bayes classifier with Gaussian Mixture Model for each class
4) Bayes Classifier with K-Nearest Neighbours method for estimation of class-conditional probability density function


Following are the files that should be run for the given tasks :
KNN.m - KNN
gmm.m - For GMM task on given dataset 
gmm_real_world_static_data.m - For GMM on real world datasets
nonParametric.m - Non Parametric KNN for artificial data
Naive_Bayes.m - For Naive Bayes task
